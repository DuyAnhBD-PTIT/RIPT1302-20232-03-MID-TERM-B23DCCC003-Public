            <ul>
                <li><h4>Focus</h4></li>
                <h5>I am a focused person. It's a quality I've developed because it helps me complete my tasks faster, keeps me sharper, and makes it easier to get several things done.</h5>
                <li><h4>Hardworking</h4></li>
                <h5>I am used to working long shifts, night shifts from my past work experience and I am not hesitate to work difficult jobs</h5>
                <li><h4>Open to criticism</h4></li>
                <h5>My ex-employer gave me high praise for being open to criticism and my ability</h5>
                <li><h4>Self-Learner</h4></li>
                <h5>I read a lot in my free time which improve my focus, patience and teach me a variety of skills in many fields</h5>
            </ul>
            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Weaknesses:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><h4>Fear of failure</h4></li>
                <h5>I'd say my number one weakness is a fear of failure. Even when I had the right answer, I refused to share my thoughts in class and became envious of those who did. I have since recognized that it is not their fault, and I've been taking mindfulness exercises to overcome this fear.</h5>
                <li><h4>Self criticism</h4></li>
                <h5>Even though I receive stellar comments from teachers, I still feel like I'm not performing to the best of my ability. This has caused periods of burnout and angry outbursts. But I've adopted a looser schedule and am trying to be fairer to myself.</h5>
